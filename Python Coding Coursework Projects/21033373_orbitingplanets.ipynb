    "## Introduction\n",
    "This python program will be investigating how planets and stars move as a result of gravitational force. How an objects physical properties such as mass, initial position and velocity will change its motion. We will also look at properties which are code related such as the 'time step' which will be used to calculate the trajectory of motion and how that changes the trajectory smoothness and accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Physics Information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Newton's law of gravitation\n",
    "Newton's Law of gravitational indicates that an 2 objects with mass will create an attractive force between each other. The scalar force on two masses m1 and m2 is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {F} = \\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- where F is the force which both masses experience\n",
    "- G is the gravitational constant:  $6.674 \\times 10^{-11} Nm^2kg^{-2}$ \n",
    "- r is the distance between the 2 masses\n",
    "\n",
    "In vector form, the direction of force is depedent on which mass which is being examined. Assuming we are looking at the force of object 2 on object 1, the gravitational force in vector form on object 1 is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\overrightarrow{F} = - \\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} \\hat{r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\hat{r} $ is the displacement unit vector from object 2 to object 1. Coupled with the negative sign, this tells us the force pulls object 1 towards object 2.  This can be rewritten in the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\overrightarrow{F} = - \\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^3} \\overrightarrow{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which also gives the force as a function of the displacement vector of object 1 from object 2. This will be used to calculate the force on a given object. By Newton's law, we also have the acceleration of object 1\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\overrightarrow{a_1} = - \\frac{Gm_2}{r^3} \\overrightarrow{r} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The acceleration of object 2 can be expressed by changing the $ m_2 $ with $ m_1 $, but also removing the negative sign as the direction of force is reversed for object 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Eulers' Method \n",
    "The motion of the planetary orbits can be animated through the use of Euler's method. This is an approximation which simulates the planets movement as a bunch of very small linear segments. The motion is adjusted depending on the values of velocity and acceleration which will be dependent on position. \n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity $v$ of an object at time $v + \\delta t$ is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v(t+\\delta t) = v(t) + a\\delta t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where v(t) was an initial velocity at a time $t$ before $t + \\delta t$. Analogously, the position of the object can be expressed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r(t+\\delta t) = r(t) + v\\delta t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\delta t $ is a time step which also dictates how often the values of acceleration, velocity and position of the object updates in a given time frame. This is arguably a property of the code as well due to its relation to how many values the computer will compute and the resultant trajectory created by the computer. Using this approximation method along with a value of acceleration being able to be found using Newton's law of gravitation and Newton's second law, we can simulate and animate the movement of planetary orbits in a gravitational field. \n",

    "\n",
    "The program should be run consecutively cell by cell. Otherwise the animation may end up running on another canvas somewhere on the top. The animations should be smooth. If there is spikes and only straight lines appear interrupt or restart the kernel."

    "- For an initial value of 1e-2 the planet started moving in a sprialing motion away from the star. This could be due to the larger time step in the animation. As the updated position and velocity is dependent on the time step, a large time step creates a value which is much larger and the change in the position between each time step is much greater. \n",
    "- Due to the fact Euler's method mimics the trajectory through small tangents, the tangents move much farther out of circular orbit and the objects position is then farther away from the star\n",
    "- But as the gravitational force and thus acceleration is inversely proportional to the distance to the star, the planet then experiences less acceleration and is not pulled towards the planet nearly as much as it should be.\n",
    "- This chain effect continues on with each time step and causes the planet to keep moving farther and father away in a spiraling orbit. \n",
    "- As the time step becomes smaller, the position does not go off in a tangent nearly as much and as a result the sprialing away is much less pronounced, until at 1e-4, the orbit becomes nearly circular. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important note is that the rate of animation affects how fast the object appears to move despite all planets having the same initial velocity. For a large time step, for a given constant rate, the position of the planet will move more and more but with a smaller time step eg. 1e-4, the position of the planet is updated the same amount, but because the position update is depedent on the size of dt, it seems to move a much smaller distance. To compensate for this, the animation rate was made varying to ensure large dt looked smooth and small dt did not move slower.\n",

Even if the time step remains the same, the position changes much more in the same time span, therefore objects which have much larger velocity such as the planets with the smaller pericenter seem to jump larger distances and cause an inaccurate spiraling motion. \n",

    "Firstly, we are able to see that the orbit of time step 1e-4 is very complex and chaotic. The orange planet takes multiple different paths of orbit as highlighted by the strange circular paths it creates. On the other hand, for a time step of 0.5e-4, the orbits look much more stable. With both planets having a somewhat more defined path. \n",

    "1. At first the red planet (planet 1) is closer to the star and starts next the orange planet (planet 2) which is slighly farther away. They approximately first move as if they were unaffected by each others mass (assume both are in a circular orbit).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. But then as time passes, they get closer together and eventually cross paths multiple times. This results in the red planet (planet 1) having its radius of orbit slightly dropped and the orange planet (planet 2) having its radius of orbit increased. It seems that the orange planet used the red planet as a slingshot transfering some energy in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The orbits of both planets then become stable for a period of time (do not change) but the planet with the smaller period time (the red planet) begins to catch up and once again the 2 masses are affected by each others gravitational force. The orange planet moves slightly further out and the red planet moves slightly further in.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We can see from the trajectory trails that the paths which the 2 planets characterized by 2 distinct orbits, one inner orbit and a larger outer orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. From the trails, we can also see that the paths of the red and orange planet meet around the left side. And their paths are farther away from each other on the right side. This may indicate that the planets only become seriously affected by each others gravitatinal force when on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps after a given time, we may consider the animation meaningless. This is due to the inaccuracies of the approximation eventually compounded to become substantial enough that the trajectories are not accurate. "

    "This can be explained by the analysis of velocity vectors. When the moon is on the inside, its velocity is in the completely opposite direction of the velocity of orbiting the sun. As a result, the velocity vectors on the moon vectorally cancel out leaving it with a low speed. When on the outside, the velocity vector from orbiting earth and the velocity vector from orbiting the sun are in the same direction and vectorally add up leading to a much greater speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should demonstrate that it is entirely possible to simulate the orbits of planetary bodies subject to a vector field such as gravity. From the animation of 2 planets under each others gravitational influence, it also seems possible to simulate how multiple vector fields interact with each other. This makes it seem possible that multiple different fields working together can be simulated eg. both a electric field and gravitational field acting on objects. But there are still limitations to the Eulers method. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accuracy \n",
    "The accuracy of the Eulers Method ultimately comes down to the nature of the mathematics which the Euler Method uses. It is fundamentally a sum of linear tangential movements which make up the movement of a given object. Firstly, it is entirely dependent on $ dt $, the time step which is used. If the code smaller time steps, the motion then becomes more and more accurate. However, the magnitude of velocity also seems to affect the accuracy, with very high speeds and acceleration, the position vector changes much more as the tangent formed is then much longer which makes the motion more inaccurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another note is that the accuracy of this method also declines with the animation time and the number of updates. This is due to the fact that the method is ultimately simulating a force vector field which is dependent on position. This means the acceleration and velocity are then all affected by the position of the object. If the position of the object is slightly off, then the acceleration and velocity values then also become inaccurate. Over time, this compounds on itself leading to bigger and bigger errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then possible to suggest that this program will be most suitable with stable, low velocity orbits. But it is possible to simulate more complex movements and at higher velocities by making the time step much smaller and the animation rate much higher. But this is a computational limit and the time step and animation rate can only be made so small and large.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Orbit of Planets\n",
    "The use of Eulers method was able to investigate how the orbits of planets will be affected by parameters such as mass, velocity and position. Given a smaller animation time and low time step, the orbits of planets can be simulated accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gravitational Interaction of 2 planets/objects\n",
    "It seems that the how 2 different planets gravity interacts with one another along with the sun can be simulated. However, different time steps give much different orbits especially when run for a long time. It can be concluded that the simulation is accurate but only for a short time otherwise any small errors compound very fast and chaotically lead to the wrong trajectories. \n"
